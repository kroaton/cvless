# About

Greetings! I'm Vladimir, a seasoned technical artist specializing in video game development, currently based in Bucharest, Romania. With over a decade of experience spanning both film and video games, I bring a wealth of expertise to every project I undertake.

My journey began in the realm of film and television, where I worked as a color grading artist and VFX specialist. Transitioning seamlessly into the world of video games, I've found my niche in procedural generation, shader creation, and character locomotion.

Proficient in Unreal Engine 5 and Houdini, I'm dedicated to pushing the boundaries of visual storytelling. Whether I'm sculpting immersive landscapes or refining character animations, I strive to blend technical precision with artistic creativity.

Beyond my professional pursuits, I'm passionate about exploring new horizons. I find inspiration in sound design, often tinkering with Eurorack synthesizers and crafting unique sonic landscapes. In addition, my interests extend to martial arts and instrument making, where I find solace in the harmony of discipline and craftsmanship.

Join me as I continue to bridge the gap between art and technology, exploring new avenues of creativity and contributing to innovative projects that captivate audiences around the world.
